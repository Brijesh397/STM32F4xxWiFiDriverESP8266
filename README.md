# STM32F4xxDriverForESP8266Module
 
● Developed WiFi driver for the STM32F407 microcontroller to work with the ESP8266 WiFi
module.<br>
● Implemented a Circular Buffer to receive data using UART Interrupts. All the data is
received from the ESP8266 WiFi module using UART Interrupts and stored inside the
Circular Buffer and then accessed by the software.<br>
● Created a TCP Server and hosted a Web Page to control hardware devices.<br>
● Connect with APIs to send and receive data to the cloud.
